# Introduction

Every open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards, for documentation.

A *consistent* style is better to follow and to understand.

A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community.

It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.
